# Supply-chain-performance-analysis
Supply chain performance analysis description

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the performance of a supply chain system using real-world structured data. It utilizes data analytics techniques to extract meaningful performance metrics such as delivery time, cost per unit, supplier performance, and more.

Objective:

To analyze supply chain data and gain insights into supplier efficiency, cost distribution, delivery performance, and overall order management using Python and data visualization tools.

Dataset:

The dataset includes columns such as:

OrderDate, DeliveryDate — used to compute delivery time

Supplier, Product Type, Status, Cost, Quantity — used for performance evaluation and cost analysis


Technologies Used:

1.Python (Data Processing & Visualization)

2.Pandas (Data Manipulation)

3.Seaborn and Matplotlib (Graphical Analysis)

4.Jupyter Notebook or VS Code (IDE for running the project)


Key Performance Metrics:

*Average Delivery Time

*On-Time Delivery Rate

*Average Cost per Unit by Supplier

*Cost vs Delivery Time relationship

*Order Volume Distribution


Visualizations Included:

*Pie chart: Delivery Status Breakdown

*Bar chart: Average Cost per Unit by Supplier

*Line chart: Delivery Time Trends per Supplier

*Heatmap: Correlation between Quantity, Cost, and Delivery Time

*Histogram: Order Quantity Distribution

*Count Plot: Delivery Status by Supplier

*Strip Plot: Cost per Unit vs Delivery Time



How to Run:

1. Clone this repository or download the Python file


2. Install dependencies (if not already installed) using: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn


3. Place your CSV file (supply_chain_data.csv) in the correct path and run the script.
